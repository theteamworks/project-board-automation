# Team process

In order to use this the team will need to follow this process. The intention is that this is as process-light as it can be for the development team when developing complex software products.

## Guiding principals

### Planning with Issues

### Tasks (Pull requests) with no issues

### Use the review process in GitHub

### Pick a card from `TODO` and add your name(s) to it

Follow:

1. Pick a card from `TODO`
1. Add your name(s) to it (pairing is cool)
1. Work on your pull request (draft, reviews, changes, merge)
1. Board is updated automatically
1. Move to `Done` after we deploy (don't let this column get too big).

Bingo! testing a change.
