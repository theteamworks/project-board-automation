# Rationale

The reason I have is because:

1. In most cases developers/testers do not want to be bogged down with remembering to update the project board
2. It is important for the status of work items to be transparent for other team members, stakeholders, managers, sponsors etc.. to see whats happening
3. In order to manage flow (keep WIP in check so throughput doesn't plummet) we need to see everything that has been started.
